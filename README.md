# 2020 Computational Linguistics Project: She is Petite . . . He is Lanky?Gender Stereotypes in Adjective Embeddings: Debias and Evaluation

The projecy was completed by Tianai Dong, Allison Keith and Anna Tramarin

This project adapt the debiasing algorithnms from Bolukbasi's [paper] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf **"Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?
Debiasing Word Embedding"** on adjective embeddings. The results are evaluated in two external metrics from  the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03862.pdf): 

**"Lipstick on a Pig: Debiasing Methods Cover up Systematic Gender Biases in Word Embeddings But do not Remove Them"**, Hila Gonen and Yoav Goldberg, NAACL 2019.

Full reimplementation of the experiments is available in "remaining_bias_2016.ipynb" for Bolukbasi's embeddings, and in "remaining_bias_2018.ipynb" for Zhao's embeddings.
