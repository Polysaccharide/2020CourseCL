# 2020 Computational Linguistics Project: She is Petite . . . He is Lanky?Gender Stereotypes in Adjective Embeddings: Debias and Evaluation

The projecy was completed by Tianai Dong, Allison Keith and Anna Tramarin

This project ran the debiasing algorithnms from Bolukbasi's the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf) **"Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?
Debiasing Word Embedding"** on adjective embeddings. The results are evaluated by two external metrics from  the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03862.pdf): **"Lipstick on a Pig: Debiasing Methods Cover up Systematic Gender Biases in Word Embeddings But do not Remove Them"**, Hila Gonen and Yoav Goldberg, NAACL 2019.
